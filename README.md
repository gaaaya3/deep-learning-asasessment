We will evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.

Experiment with different architectures, activation functions, or hyperparameters:
We will tweak the model's architecture by adding more layers or changing hyperparameters to improve performance.
Possible improvements:
1.Add more hidden layers or neurons
2.Change the activation functions
3.Experiment with a different optimizer like RMSprop or SGD
4.Use regularization techniques like Dropout or L2 regularization
